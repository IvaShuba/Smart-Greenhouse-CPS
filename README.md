# Smart-Greenhouse-CPS
Modular smart‑greenhouse control system using two microcontroller nodes. Developed bare‑metal firmware for sensing, actuation, SPI communication, and power‑efficient operation. Built a command‑based protocol, state‑machine control logic, and LCD. Integrated soil, light, temperature, and humidity sensors with fan, pump, servo, and LED drivers.
